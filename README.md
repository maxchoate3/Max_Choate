Growing up in a family of entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurial mindset is ingrained in me. My fascination with technology has been a constant, and over the years, I've channeled this passion into various projects and roles spanning website design, product management, and beyond.

Through these experiences, I've recognized that I am a builder. I am deeply passionate about working across disciplines to plan, develop, and enhance customer-centric technology products and services.
